# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

Scientific analyses often generate large amounts of data. In order to gain insight into these large datasets, visualisations can be extremely useful.

Many tools may generate visualisation as part of their output, but Galaxy also offers a wide range of built-in, general-purpose visualisation options for your data. In this tutorials we will familiarize you with using these built-in visualisations in order to get the most out of your data.

# Background

In this tutorial, we will use as our dataset a table with results from the Olympics, from the games in Athens in 1896 until Tokyo in 2020. The objective is to familiarize you with a large number of the most important data manipulation tools in Galaxy. Much like the Olympics, there are many different disciplines (types of operations), and for each operation there are often multiple techniques (tools) available to athletes (data analysts, you) that are great for achieving the goal.

We will show you many of these commonly needed data manipulation operations, and some examples of how to perform them in Galaxy. We also provide many exercises so that you can train your skills and become a data manipulation Olympian!

# Upload Data

Before we can do any manipulation, we will need some data. Let's upload our table with olympics results now.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Get data
>
> 1. {% tool [Import](upload1) %} the file `olympics.tsv` via link
>
>    ```
>    {{page.zenodo_link}}/files/olympics.tsv
>    ```
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/datasets_import_via_link.md %}

> 2. **Expand** on the item in your history to see some metadata and a short preview of the contents.
>
> 3. **View** {% icon galaxy-eye %} the dataset by clicking on the eye icon.

>    >
>    > 1. What is the format of the file?
>    > 2. What does each row represent?
>    > 3. How many lines are in the file? (Hint: {% tool [Line/Word/Character count](wc_gnu) %})
>    > 4. How many columns?
>    >
>    > > ### {% icon solution %} Answer
>    > >
>    > > 1. When you expand the dataset, you will see `format: tabular`, this is another term for a tab-separated (`tsv`) file.
>    > > 2. Each row represents an athlete's participation in an event. If an athlete competes in multiple events, there is a line for each event.
>    > > 3. 234,523. Look at the expanded view in the history, this tells us there are ~250,000 rows in the dataset. We can get the exact number using the  {% tool [Line/Word/Character count](wc_gnu) %} tool.
>    > > 4. There are 17 columns in this file. There are multiple ways to find this answer:
>    > >    - Count the columns (only doable for small files)
>    > >    - In the expanded view, scroll sideways on the dataset preview, at the top the columns are numbered
>    > >    - Click on the {% icon galaxy-info %} i icon on the dataset, here you will find more detailed information about the file and the job that created it.

## About this dataset

The data was [obtained](https://github.com/UOSCS/Olympic_Athletes) from [Olympedia](https://www.olympedia.org/). The file `olympics.tsv` contains
234,522 rows and 17 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event. The columns are:

- **athlete_id** - Unique number for each athlete
- **name** - Athlete's name
- **sex** - M or F
- **birth_year** - 4-digit number
- **birth_day** - e.g. 24 July
- **birth_place** - town and/or country
- **height** - In centimeters
- **weight** - In kilograms
- **team** - Team name
- **noc** - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
- **games** - Year and season
- **year** - Integer
- **season** - Summer or Winter
- **city** - Host city
- **sport** - Sport
- **event** - Event
- **medal** - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

We will use this dataset to practice our data visualisation skills in Galaxy.


# Choose your adventure!

This tutorial is structured a bit differently than most. **You do not have to do the steps in the order they are presented below.** Every section in this tutorial uses the dataset you just uploaded (the `olympics.tsv` file) as input, so you can jump to any section in this tutorial right now if you have a particular data manipulation operation in mind you want to learn more about.
