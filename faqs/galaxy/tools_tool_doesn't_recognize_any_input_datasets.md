This could be due to:
1. Simple datatype assignment incompatibility between the dataset and the tool. Expected input datatype format is explained on the Tool form itself on the input parameter or on the information section below the Execute button. To convert datatpe see [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/datasets_change_datatype.md %}).
2. Not selecting the desired dataset collection on the input parameter. See [this FAQ]({% link faqs/galaxy/tools_select_collection.md %}) to select collection.
