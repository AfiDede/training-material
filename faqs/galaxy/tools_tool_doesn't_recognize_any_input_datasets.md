This is usually a simple datatype assignment incompatibility between the dataset and the tool.
Expected input datatype format is explained on the Tool form itself on the "Please provide a value for this option" section or on the information section below the Execute button.

1. Click on the pencil icon {% icon galaxy-pencil %} found on the dataset to reach the **Edit Dataset Attributes** form.
2. Click on the datatypes tab to convert the format.
3. Click on the **Save** button.
